# Networking

## Networking types and standards:

## Peer-based

#### Purpose

A peer-to-peer network is created when two or more PCs are connected and share resources without going through a separate server computer. P2P can also be used to create links between dozens of computers in an office over copper wires. You can also make them on a much wider scale with special protocols and applications which set up direct relationships among users over the internet.

#### Benefits

The first benefit of using Peer to Peer is that there is no need for a networking operating system. Secondly you do not need to go and buy an expensive server because they are individual workstations and they are used to access the files by themselves. Thirdly each user manages their own computer this means that a network manager is not required. Finally, if a PC was to fail in the network then it does not bring the whole network down it just means that the certain PC cannot be reached at the moment  

#### Communications

The way that the PCs are able to communicate with each other in a P2P network is that they are normally all connected straight to either a hub or a switch. Sometimes they can be connected straight to each other. This means that there is only traffic running two ways though copper straight though cable so there is not much packet loss and the transfer time can be quick.

#### Working Practice

A working practice for P2P would be how you use it in a day to day manor. For example, it could be at work for a design team throwing ideas and design to one another easily though the network. you could also have a P2P Network at home if you are running more than one PC in the house so you can access the same files any where

#### Commercial Opportunity

P2P can be used primarily in a smaller company as if you trying to spread a P2P network though a big office complete firstly you will have loads of cabling secondly the stress on the PCs will be much will all the files going around. So I would limit P2P to smaller projects in companyâ€™s so that the load does not become too much. 

#### Information Sharing

P2P is very good a sharing information as long as it is not too big of a network it can work well. The peer-to-peer movement allowed millions of Internet users to connect "directly, forming groups and collaborating to become user-created search engines, virtual supercomputers, and file systems

## Design Of Network System

## Testing And Evaluation Of Design

We were tasked to create two local star network that connected via a switch to three PCs, One PC and a Router. Once we have created them we need to be able to ping from one of the PCs and be able to ping a PC on the other network. The design you can see above is how I will be going about these requirements and making the networks. Firstly, I needed to know the user requirements so I could break it down using Scrum.

*	Have Two Different Local Networks
*	Be Able To Add More PCs If Needed
*	Be Able Communicate Between the Two Networks
*	See That The Network Is Laid Out As A Star Network 
*	Be Able To Add Printers

These were the main 5 user requirements that we had to meet with are networking system. Firstly, we had to have two different local networks running independently with three PCs each and a server each. These 4 components then had to connect to a switch each then to a router. Once we had all of these on each side we could start to connect it all with straight though cable and get the two networks working.

Secondly we need to be able to add more PCs if it is needed later on down the road so when was setting up the switch which everything is connected to I added more slots for the cabling from the extra PCs. They may never be used but seeing as I had to add another to get the other three in you may as well fill it up just in case. This saves time if it come to adding more PCs.

Thirdly the two different local networks had to be able to communicate between each other so that a PC on one side can ping another on the other network. We got this to work by adding a Serial DTE cable running from the two serial ports on the routers together so that they are pretty much linked now packets can pass through to each other but they can be miles apart. We tested this by pinging one PC on the family guy side from the Simpson side. The result was that it worked 

The idea of the network was to make it a Star network, this means that there is centre and everything revolves around it. The centre of are networks where the switches. Everything had to run though the switches no matter where information was going.

As an extension we could add in two printers into the networks one on each side and get them to link up to the network as well.

The network above is the finished network completed to the spec of the user requirements and also it follows my design that you can see in the section above. I decided to add in the printers on each side as I had extra time when I finished the main part of the network. I have listed all of the information for the servers and routers. The network follows the design that I made earlier on in the project. It also meets all the requirements that I needed to meet. 

## Analyse Test Results 

I Created a test plan to show off the outcome of the final network against the design and requirements that it needed to meet from the start of the project. The test plan shows what was tested and the outcome. I also included the expected result which is what I wanted and expected to happen. Then the actual outcome which is what the real outcome was. I was hoping the actual outcome is the same as the expected outcome as that is what I need to happen to meet the requirements
