# Networking

## Networking types and standards:

## Peer-based

#### Purpose

A peer-to-peer network is created when two or more PCs are connected and share resources without going through a separate server computer. P2P can also be used to create links between dozens of computers in an office over copper wires. You can also make them on a much wider scale with special protocols and applications which set up direct relationships among users over the internet.

#### Benefits

The first benefit of using Peer to Peer is that there is no need for a networking operating system. Secondly you do not need to go and buy an expensive server because they are individual workstations and they are used to access the files by themselves. Thirdly each user manages their own computer this means that a network manager is not required. Finally, if a PC was to fail in the network then it does not bring the whole network down it just means that the certain PC cannot be reached at the moment  

#### Communications

The way that the PCs are able to communicate with each other in a P2P network is that they are normally all connected straight to either a hub or a switch. Sometimes they can be connected straight to each other. This means that there is only traffic running two ways though copper straight though cable so there is not much packet loss and the transfer time can be quick.

#### Working Practice

A working practice for P2P would be how you use it in a day to day manor. For example, it could be at work for a design team throwing ideas and design to one another easily though the network. you could also have a P2P Network at home if you are running more than one PC in the house so you can access the same files any where

#### Commercial Opportunity

P2P can be used primarily in a smaller company as if you trying to spread a P2P network though a big office complete firstly you will have loads of cabling secondly the stress on the PCs will be much will all the files going around. So I would limit P2P to smaller projects in company’s so that the load does not become too much. 

#### Information Sharing

P2P is very good a sharing information as long as it is not too big of a network it can work well. The peer-to-peer movement allowed millions of Internet users to connect "directly, forming groups and collaborating to become user-created search engines, virtual supercomputers, and file systems

## Client-server

#### Purpose

A client server is a network that is based around the client. The user’s computer will send requests to the server though the internet. The server will manage and sort the requests it will then provide the user with the information needed. Any type of request can be sent to the server but they do have filters so some requests can be blocked via firewalls and antivirus software. It will only let though requests that fit the correct requirements 

#### Benefits

The first benefit of running a client based server is that you can add an endless amount of people to it as long as the sever can handle it. The system is centralised so it makes it easy to add resources and clients. The second benefit is that it is easy to manage as all the resources come from one server which everyone is connected to so if you can manage the server then you can manage everything connected to it as well. Another benefit is the server can be very fast at responding to the user’s requests. So fast that by the time it takes for the website to load it can be about 3 seconds depending on internet speeds. Finally, the server has very good security for all it users as the server can have many different types of encryptions and different firewalls to keep information safe. 

#### Resource Implications

The resource implications for a client server depends on many different things. Firstly, the user could have slow internet and if they are receiving a big file then it can take time for it to travel. Also if there is a lot of people throwing requests at the server then requests can get delayed or lost. This can slow it down as well. But if you have good speeds and the server is not busy you should have no problems getting what you need.

#### Communications

The Users on the PC will send a request to the server though the internet. It will have to travel though several security measures. Like firewalls and anti-virus. One the sever receives the request it will filter it and find the best answer or answers for the users request then send it back to them and display it on their screen.  

#### Working Practice

Client server is mostly used for websites and large file applications because this type of networking can provide powerful servers which can handle large amount of people and requests at one time. This is needed for website or an application as the users will need many requests. It can also keep all the users safe. An example of a client server is Google

#### Commercial Opportunity

A commercial opportunity for a client server could be that someone is creating a database and it will be accessed through the internet from users all over the world and they will need a way to search the database so you create a client server so it can process their request for them and send it back without the user needs to manually search the database 

#### Information Sharing

The users can also upload to the server so if someone was trying to send a piece of data to another person they will upload to the server and the other user will retrieve it from the server 

 

## Cloud

#### Purpose

The cloud computing allows users to access shared pools of system resources and high level services that can rapidly provisioned with minimal management effort. Cloud computing relies on sharing resources to achieve coherence and economies scale. Similar to a public utility third party clouds allow companies and organizations to focus on their core business instead of expending resources on computer infrastructure and maintenance.

#### Benefits

The first benefit of cloud computing is the biggest reason why people us it so much. That is that you can work from anywhere that has internet access as you save all of your work to the cloud and all you need to retrieve that is the internet. Another benefit is unlimited storage as long as you want to continue to pay for more and more storage you can store as much data to the cloud as you want. Thirdly disaster recovery the cloud keeps frequent backups of work uploaded it to and sometimes the cloud is used by companies as a backup in case of a disaster.  

#### Resource Implications

The resource implications for a cloud server is simple as all it is from the user’s side is uploading and downloading work that you need or want to store. If you are somewhere with good internet, then uploading and downloading will not be a problem it comes when you don’t have internet access you can get your work. 

#### Communications

The communication is between the device that is uploading or downloading work from the server and the server its self. Work will be transferred via the internet between the two this is why the internet is so important for the cloud. Once the file is uploaded then the cloud will have a certain storage for the file under the users account.

#### Working Practice

This method can be used in many different work places and at home. For example, in a work place if you are running a different team under a project then everyone will need to access each other’s work. So to make it easy if everyone was to upload to the cloud under different folders then everyone can get a copy of the work and see each other’s progress in real time. Also at home if you want to retrieve data from your PC on your tablet then as long as it is saved on the cloud all you need to sign in and you will be able to open it. It can also be used in school to give out work to many students instead of emails. All the students could access the cloud though the internet on their own PCs.

#### Commercial Opportunity

The commercial opportunity for the cloud is very strong as almost all companies are on the internet and need storage so companies will hire out space to save data. Then once they fill up their storage they will hire out more. Also normal day to day people need storage as well so they will most likely hire out storage as well 

#### Information Sharing

The cloud is probably one of the best ways to share data as you can invite people to your work and they can work on it with you in real time and also they can save copies for themselves. Also if you are moving work from a personal cloud to someone else all you have to do Is email it or invite them to join it and then they can save it. 


## Cluster

#### Purpose

A cluster in networking is a bunch of PCs set to perform the same task controlled and scheduled by certain software. Clusters are usually connected to each other fast local area networks. With each node running its own instance of an operating system 

#### Benefits

The benefits of cluster networks are. Firstly, they are scalable which means that resources can be added to the cluster at any time. Secondly if a dedicated server from the cluster requires maintenance then it can be stopped while others servers handle its load. This means that it keeps running while under maintenance.

#### Communications

The way a cluster network communicates within its self is that the whole network is ran through a piece of software so the PCs don’t talk to each other they just all talk to the switch and router the PCs just work for the software.

#### Working Practice

Cluster networks are using in working practices to handle heavy loads of work as they can manage many computers at once and do many different tasks at once without putting too much stress on the network. for example, if you had 1 PC with 5 jobs to do that where automated but took an hour each then it is going to take 5 hours. If you were to run it on a cluster with 5 different PCs, then it would only take an hour

#### Commercial Opportunity

The commercial opportunity is high as a lot of web server companies and other server companies have a lot of data passing through them and can need sorting, fixing or work data will need to be pulled and assigning this to a cluster which can do the work of many different PCs will not only save time but money as well


## Centralised

#### Purpose

Centralised networks are when all the user’s PCs are connecting to a server with no internet connection it is just a bunch of PCs in a star lay out all connected to a single server. The server will store all their account information and handle all the communication that comes out of each PC. This can put a lot of stress on a single switch.

#### Benefits

Some benefits of using a centralised network are. Firstly, the network is easy to manage as it is all hooked up to a server. Secondly this can reduce the cost as most of the time these are ran in house so it can save money. Thirdly it is easy to add another user to the network as all you do is plug the PC in to the server and you are good to go. Finally, you can run everything though the server so you can roll out updates or work to all users

#### Resource Implications

The resource implications for a centralised network is firstly not expensive as you only have PCs and a server. Also, they are all hooked up though cables which can sometimes get in the way if not managed correctly but are consistent at passing data though. Thirdly the network can be running off the server and easily managed   

#### Communications

There is only one way the network communicates with each other and that is though cables that run to the server then the server puts it out to the other PCs. Nothing is connected to the internet so no data leaves the network though the PCs unless taken off the network and uploaded.

#### Working Practice

The way the network runs is entirely up to the person managing the network though the server and the people on the PCs. Centralised would normally be used by a team of people using the server to transfer work and data to one another if they were in a spread-out office as it is quicker than email or USB.

#### Information Sharing

Centralised is very good for sharing files in house. So, in an office for a team project but when it comes to getting work on the internet it cannot do so. As it is basically an inhouse version of a client server which runs the same but though the internet 


## Virtualised

#### Purpose 

Network virtualisation is the ability to create logical virtual networks that are run form the underlying network hardware to ensure the network can better integrate with virtual environments. So in simple terms you are creating a simulate of a hardware platform suck as a server, storage or any other network resource in a selected software.  

#### benefits

The first benefit of using virtualised networks are. That it saves spending time and money on actual hardware like buying it and then setting it up. The software will do that for you. Secondly the security is very strong on them as it will on be generated from one PC so if that PC is secure then the whole network should be secure. Another benefit if the energy costs as it would cost a lot to run multiple PCs and switches and many other network devices but you can do it for the energy cost of one PC if you virtualize it.

#### resource implications

The resource implications to run a virtualised network costs know where near the price of trying to run it with real hardware this is one of the main points why people do it. Also you can run it off one PC which will need to be high spec but you will still save money instead of buying all the hardware. Apart from a PC all you will need is an internet connection and if you are in an office block that is easy to get hold of.

#### communications

The communication of the virtual network depends on the network that you are setting up inside the virtualisation. 

#### working practice

virtualised networks can be used in work places all the time for many different things such as testing new networks or training new people on networking as you may not want them handling actual hardware. Also it can be used to be a running network within a company running off of one machine.

#### commercial opportunity

virtual networks have a huge market for people that just coming to networking as everything is virtual you cannot break anything and you save a lot of time and money with not having to buy hardware and set it up. 

#### information sharing

the only information that is shared is within the virtual network.



## Conceptual models:
### OSI Model

Physical – The first layer in the OSI Model. The job of the first layer is to convey the bit stream, electrical impulse, light or radio signal though the network. it provides the hardware means of sending and receiving data to a user including the important cables, cards and physical aspects.

Data Link – The second layer of the OSI Model is Data Link. This layer receives data packet and encoded and decoded which it turns into bits. It uses the transmission protocell knowledge and management to handle the errors in the physical layer. The data link layer is divided in two sub layers. The media access control layer and the logical link control layer. The media access layer controls how a computer on the network gamins access to the data and permission to transmit data. The logical link layer controls frame synchronization and flow control as well as error checking 

Network – Network is the third layer in the OSI Model. Layer 3 provides switching and routing which creates logical paths known as virtual circuits for transmitting data from node to node.

Transport – The fourth layer of the OSI Model is the transport layer. This layer transfers data between end systems. It is also responsible for end to end recovery and flow control. All of these ensure that the data is transferred completely 

Session – the fifth layer in the OSI Model is Session. This later is responsible for managing connections between applications. The session layer also sets up the applications like its coordinates, terminates conversations and exchanges. It also handles the connection  

Presentation – The sixth layer of the OSI model is Presentation. The presentation layer manages Indi pended data representation for example encryption. It does this my translating application to network format. The layer works to transform data into the form that can be accepted by the application layer. 

Application – Application is the last layer in the OSI. This layer provides application services for file transfers, email and other network software services. It supports the end user processes such as communication partners and user authentication privacy 

### TCP/IP Model

TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, it is loads of different protocols that come together in order to connect devices over the internet. It has 4 different layers each with their own responsibilities and tasks. These are:


Application - This layer is responsible for specifying which protocol is to be used by what application or data.

Transport - The Transport layer is responsible for creating and maintaining communication between the sender and the reciever. Only two protocols are used in this later. TCP which has a system in place to check if the recipient and recieved the data, and UDP which doenst check if the recipient has got the data.

Internet - This layer is responsible for segmenting any data sent into packets, these packets are then routed to the recipient using the recipients IP address.

Network Access - The Network Access layer is responsible for interfacing with your network’s architecture. It is also at this layer that error checking information is applied to sent data so the recipient can check for errors.

## Working standards and protocols:

### IEEE 802.3

IEEE 802.3 is a standard Ethernet. Which is used as a method of physical communication in a local area network.  IEEE 802.3 defines the physical layer and the media access control. It could be stated that the IEEE 802.3 could otherwise be known as the ethernet standard that defines the physical layer on a model. The connection speeds of a IEEE 802.3 ethernet is 10Mbits/s which is equal to 1.25MB/s.

### IEEE 802.7

IEEE 802.7 is the standard assigned to a broadband connection. It is outlined in the designs and implementation of the connection. It also outlines some different methods of testing connections

### IEEE 802.8

IEEE refers to the standard of fibre optic connection. Within a LAN. It is in the same group as the previous standards and outlines many of the same defining features however is called a standard by itself as it covers a different connection type

### IEEE 802.11

IEEE 802.11 is the standard of wireless connections. Wireless connection is the most common internet connection in this day. It also follows the standards in Wi -Fi. This standard outline what frequencies are used via wireless access points and hubs 

### Routed Protocols

A routed protocol is a protocol where data can be routed all over the place. In this kind of protocols, it requires an addressing scheme and subnetting. Addressing scheme will be used to determine the network to which a host belongs and to identifying that host on that network. Making it so you can transfer data from one PC to another. One type and the most popular type of routing protocol is IP addresses. They are a reason that IP addresses are more popular than other routed protocols.

### IPv4

IPv4 stands for Internet Protocol version 4. It is one of the core protocols of standards-based internetworking methods in the Internet. It is the fourth revision of the internet protocol. It is used widely in data communication over different types of networks. IPv4 is a wireless protocol used in packet-switched layer networks such as Ethernet. It provides the connection between network devices by providing identification for each device known as a IP Address. 

### IPv6 

IPv6 is the new generation of internet protocols. It was created to eventually replace IPv4 when it runs out of room to generate new IPs. The protocol IPv4 is still used in many Internet services still use today. Every computer, mobile phone, and any other device connected to the Internet needs a numerical IP address to communicate with other devices. The original IP address scheme, called IPv4, is running out of addresses.

## Services and network applications:

### FTP

FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. FTP is a protocol for transmitting files between computers on the internet over TCP/IP connections. FTP is a client server protocol that relies on two communication channels between client and server. When using FTP users can upload, download, delete, rename, move and copy files on a server

### HTTP

HTTP means HyperText Transfer Protocol. HTTP is the protocol used by the World Wide Web and this protocol defines how messages are formatted and transmitted over the internet and what actions web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands.

### SMTP

SMTP means Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, it uses the TCP/IP protocol when sending and receiving emails. The modern email services use this protocol. 

### POP3

POP3 means Post Office Protocol 3 it is the most recent version of a standard protocol for receiving emails. The client emails are stored on a server which means it can downloaded by the user and deleted afterwards.

### SSL

SSL Stands for Secure Socket Layers. SSL is all about security in the communication over the internet by using specific security methods such as encryption 


## The Impact Of Networking Topology, Communication And Bandwidth:

### Topologies:

#### Logical:

A logical topology is a set of fragments that define the specific arrangement and communication of nodes on a network.

##### Ethernet:

Ethernet is a type of logical topology. Ethernet is the most common LAN technology. Ethernet formats exactly how data is going to be transmitted to other network devices which are on the same network. 

##### Token Ring:

A token ring is a LAN in which computers are connected in a ring or star topology and pass one or more logical tokens from host to host. Only the host who holds the token can send data

#### Physical:

A physical topology is the physical hardware of a network. This can consist of the clients and the cables on the network connecting them. This allows organisations to physically layout the network

##### Star:

The star topology is when all the devices and clients are connected to one central node which would mainly be a hub or switch.

##### Ring:

The ring topology is when all the clients and devices on the network are connected to one other devices on that network in a circle layout such as PC1 connected to PC2 and PC2 connect to a server.

##### Bus:

The bus topology is when all the clients and devices are connected on a single line which are terminated on both ends.


### Communication:

Communication in networking evolves two or more machines sending and receiving data for each other. One of the simplest forms of communication in a network is when a pc requests data from a server. This can range from simple to complex questions to the server to get what you are after. For example, if a user is trying to retrieve some information off a website then first you would load up the web page which means your two networks are connecting and already exchanging information. This is where security comes in because if one of the networks doesn’t like what it is seeing then it will either stop u from entering the website or kick you off. This is the firewalls doing their job reading the packets coming in and out.  Another example is sending data when sent If the data passes the screening from the other user’s firewall then it will be allowed through however if not, it is sent back to the sender. There are occasions where data is falsely identified to be harmful which results in the data not being sent however this is a rare occurrence.

## Glossary of Operating Principles:
### Networking devices:

#### Hubs

Hubs are the connection points for devices within a network. It manages all the traffic and routes it to its destination over the local connections. The hub contains multiple ports that the clients and devices and connect to access other devices on the local area network.

#### Routers

Routers are what connects multiple local network together and acts as the set router for its local network and will connect to many other local network routers so they can link and send information back and forth.  A router receives packets of data with address attached to them. The router can read it and see where to send it.

#### Switches

A Switch is a device on the network that all the devices connect to. It uses packet switching to redirect, receive and process information and data and then forward the data to their destination across a LAN. 

#### Multilayer switch

A multilayer switch that operates much more efficient them a normal switch and therefore increases the speed of the data transfer to anything connected to it

#### Firewall

A Firewall is a piece of Security software that is made to filter traffic entering a network for client or website to make sure that unwanted software enters the user’s PC or Network.

#### HIDS

HIDS is known as host-based intrusion detection system is used to detect a threat to a user’s PC or networks. It searches though data being sent though networks and looks for things that could be a threat 

#### Repeaters

Repeaters are devices that are used to make a signal stronger that is being sent over a large distance on a LAN, this allows the size of LANs to be much larger. 

#### Bridges

Bridges are used to get a connection with other networks that are also using a bridge. One thing you must make sure is that both networks are using the same protocols. If they do not match then they will not be able to connect to each other.

#### Access point 

Access points are used to give users with a connection to a network. But they are physically not connected to that network they are somewhere that their provider has a access point so you can connect wirelessly. Wireless access points are the most common, they use Wi-Fi to allow the users to connect to the network remotely.

#### Content filter

A content filter is very simple and has one job. It uses rules that where set by a admin or another user and any data coming in to the network or PC will be checked against the rules and it will be let through or reflected. For example, spam, or malicious. Email servers commonly use content filters to filter spam emails.

#### Load balancer

A load balancer is used to spread out the workload over the entire network. These are implemented when it gets busy as it can spread the load and reduce the stress. This increases the productivity on the network as well-meaning if you are falling behind you should be able to get back on track 

#### Modem 

A modem is used to connect networks to an existing telephone line. While this can be good for reaching remote areas, they do not have amazing speeds.

#### Packet shaper 

A packet shaper is used to prioritise certain data being sent over the network. It forces lower priority packets to wait and for the network to prioritise high importance data first. 

#### VPN concentrator

A VPN concentrator is used to allow multiple users on the same network to use the same VPN, it does this by coordinating and organising the traffic on a network between different machines trying to access the VPN.

### Server types:

#### Web

A Web Server stores and sends data on websites over the internet. A user will make a request to the web server for information on how to display the webpage and what information needs to be loaded. The server handles this request and sends a copy of the data to the user. Thousands of requests can be handles by a web server at any given time. An example of this is Google as it is used billions of times a day with users asking simple requests. 

#### File

A file server is used to store files and data for users on the network to access whenever they need it. The data stored on this server can range from public data that anyone on the network can have access to. Or private data that only a specific user can access. For example, OneDrive 

#### Database

A database server is a type of server that stores data.  The data stored on these servers are related to one another so that requests can be made for other information pertaining to a certain subject. 

#### Combination

A combination server is a server has the function of the file server and the database server together. This server can perform the same actions as the file server and the database server at the same time.

#### Virtualisation

Virtualisation servers are servers that can have completely virtualise a network set up with everything you need using certain software and running it off hardware in your own PC

#### Terminal Services Server

A terminal service is a service that allows a user to take control of a remote computer or virtual machine using a network connection. This can allow a user to control aspects of other PC's from one PC to save time and resources and to prevent the user from going to each PC and changing them manually

## Design Of Network System

## Testing And Evaluation Of Design

We were tasked to create two local star network that connected via a switch to three PCs, One PC and a Router. Once we have created them we need to be able to ping from one of the PCs and be able to ping a PC on the other network. The design you can see above is how I will be going about these requirements and making the networks. Firstly, I needed to know the user requirements so I could break it down using Scrum.

*	Have Two Different Local Networks
*	Be Able To Add More PCs If Needed
*	Be Able Communicate Between the Two Networks
*	See That The Network Is Laid Out As A Star Network 
*	Be Able To Add Printers

These were the main 5 user requirements that we had to meet with are networking system. Firstly, we had to have two different local networks running independently with three PCs each and a server each. These 4 components then had to connect to a switch each then to a router. Once we had all of these on each side we could start to connect it all with straight though cable and get the two networks working.

Secondly we need to be able to add more PCs if it is needed later on down the road so when was setting up the switch which everything is connected to I added more slots for the cabling from the extra PCs. They may never be used but seeing as I had to add another to get the other three in you may as well fill it up just in case. This saves time if it come to adding more PCs.

Thirdly the two different local networks had to be able to communicate between each other so that a PC on one side can ping another on the other network. We got this to work by adding a Serial DTE cable running from the two serial ports on the routers together so that they are pretty much linked now packets can pass through to each other but they can be miles apart. We tested this by pinging one PC on the family guy side from the Simpson side. The result was that it worked 

The idea of the network was to make it a Star network, this means that there is centre and everything revolves around it. The centre of are networks where the switches. Everything had to run though the switches no matter where information was going.

As an extension we could add in two printers into the networks one on each side and get them to link up to the network as well.  

## Network System
![netowrking](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927415/40111305-60271a1c-58fa-11e8-83ac-ae15d0f6fff9.PNG)

The network above is the finished network completed to the spec of the user requirements and also it follows my design that you can see in the section above. I decided to add in the printers on each side as I had extra time when I finished the main part of the network. I have listed all of the information for the servers and routers. The network follows the design that I made earlier on in the project. It also meets all the requirements that I needed to meet. 

## Analyse Test Results 

I Created a test plan to show off the outcome of the final network against the design and requirements that it needed to meet from the start of the project. The test plan shows what was tested and the outcome. I also included the expected result which is what I wanted and expected to happen. Then the actual outcome which is what the real outcome was. I was hoping the actual outcome is the same as the expected outcome as that is what I need to happen to meet the requirements
