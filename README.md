## Testing And Evaluation Of Design

We were tasked to create two local star network that connected via a switch to three PCs, One PC and a Router. Once we have created them we need to be able to ping from one of the PCs and be able to ping a PC on the other network. The design you can see above is how I will be going about these requirements and making the networks. Firstly, I needed to know the user requirements so I could break it down using Scrum.

*	Have Two Different Local Networks
*	Be Able To Add More PCs If Needed
*	Be Able Communicate Between the Two Networks
*	See That The Network Is Laid Out As A Star Network 
*	Be Able To Add Printers

 These were the main 5 user requirements that we had to meet with are networking system. Firstly, we had to have two different local networks running independently with three PCs each and a server each. These 4 components then had to connect to a switch each then to a router. Once we had all of these on each side we could start to connect it all with straight though cable and get the two networks working.

Secondly we need to be able to add more PCs if it is needed later on down the road so when was setting up the switch which everything is connected to I added more slots for the cabling from the extra PCs. They may never be used but seeing as I had to add another to get the other three in you may as well fill it up just in case. This saves time if it come to adding more PCs.

Thirdly the two different local networks had to be able to communicate between each other so that a PC on one side can ping another on the other network. We got this to work by adding a Serial DTE cable running from the two serial ports on the routers together so that they are pretty much linked now packets can pass through to each other but they can be miles apart. We tested this by pinging one PC on the family guy side from the Simpson side. The result was that it worked 

The idea of the network was to make it a Star network, this means that there is centre and everything revolves around it. The centre of are networks where the switches. Everything had to run though the switches no matter where information was going.

As an extension we could add in two printers into the networks one on each side and get them to link up to the network as well.

The network above is the finished network completed to the spec of the user requirements and also it follows my design that you can see in the section above. I decided to add in the printers on each side as I had extra time when I finished the main part of the network. I have listed all of the information for the servers and routers. The network follows the design that I made earlier on in the project. It also meets all the requirements that I needed to meet.
