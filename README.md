# Networking

## Networking types and standards:

## Peer-based

#### Purpose

A peer-to-peer network is created when two or more PCs are connected and share resources without going through a separate server computer. P2P can also be used to create links between dozens of computers in an office over copper wires. You can also make them on a much wider scale with special protocols and applications which set up direct relationships among users over the internet.

#### Benefits

The first benefit of using Peer to Peer is that there is no need for a networking operating system. Secondly you do not need to go and buy an expensive server because they are individual workstations and they are used to access the files by themselves. Thirdly each user manages their own computer this means that a network manager is not required. Finally, if a PC was to fail in the network then it does not bring the whole network down it just means that the certain PC cannot be reached at the moment  

#### Communications

The way that the PCs are able to communicate with each other in a P2P network is that they are normally all connected straight to either a hub or a switch. Sometimes they can be connected straight to each other. This means that there is only traffic running two ways though copper straight though cable so there is not much packet loss and the transfer time can be quick.

#### Working Practice

A working practice for P2P would be how you use it in a day to day manor. For example, it could be at work for a design team throwing ideas and design to one another easily though the network. you could also have a P2P Network at home if you are running more than one PC in the house so you can access the same files any where

#### Commercial Opportunity

P2P can be used primarily in a smaller company as if you trying to spread a P2P network though a big office complete firstly you will have loads of cabling secondly the stress on the PCs will be much will all the files going around. So I would limit P2P to smaller projects in company’s so that the load does not become too much. 

#### Information Sharing

P2P is very good a sharing information as long as it is not too big of a network it can work well. The peer-to-peer movement allowed millions of Internet users to connect "directly, forming groups and collaborating to become user-created search engines, virtual supercomputers, and file systems

## Client-server

#### Purpose

A client server is a network that is based around the client. The user’s computer will send requests to the server though the internet. The server will manage and sort the requests it will then provide the user with the information needed. Any type of request can be sent to the server but they do have filters so some requests can be blocked via firewalls and antivirus software. It will only let though requests that fit the correct requirements 

#### Benefits

The first benefit of running a client based server is that you can add an endless amount of people to it as long as the sever can handle it. The system is centralised so it makes it easy to add resources and clients. The second benefit is that it is easy to manage as all the resources come from one server which everyone is connected to so if you can manage the server then you can manage everything connected to it as well. Another benefit is the server can be very fast at responding to the user’s requests. So fast that by the time it takes for the website to load it can be about 3 seconds depending on internet speeds. Finally, the server has very good security for all it users as the server can have many different types of encryptions and different firewalls to keep information safe. 

#### Resource Implications

The resource implications for a client server depends on many different things. Firstly, the user could have slow internet and if they are receiving a big file then it can take time for it to travel. Also if there is a lot of people throwing requests at the server then requests can get delayed or lost. This can slow it down as well. But if you have good speeds and the server is not busy you should have no problems getting what you need.

#### Communications

The Users on the PC will send a request to the server though the internet. It will have to travel though several security measures. Like firewalls and anti-virus. One the sever receives the request it will filter it and find the best answer or answers for the users request then send it back to them and display it on their screen.  

#### Working Practice

Client server is mostly used for websites and large file applications because this type of networking can provide powerful servers which can handle large amount of people and requests at one time. This is needed for website or an application as the users will need many requests. It can also keep all the users safe. An example of a client server is Google

#### Commercial Opportunity

A commercial opportunity for a client server could be that someone is creating a database and it will be accessed through the internet from users all over the world and they will need a way to search the database so you create a client server so it can process their request for them and send it back without the user needs to manually search the database 

#### Information Sharing

The users can also upload to the server so if someone was trying to send a piece of data to another person they will upload to the server and the other user will retrieve it from the server 

 

## Cloud

#### Purpose

The cloud computing allows users to access shared pools of system resources and high level services that can rapidly provisioned with minimal management effort. Cloud computing relies on sharing resources to achieve coherence and economies scale. Similar to a public utility third party clouds allow companies and organizations to focus on their core business instead of expending resources on computer infrastructure and maintenance.

#### Benefits

The first benefit of cloud computing is the biggest reason why people us it so much. That is that you can work from anywhere that has internet access as you save all of your work to the cloud and all you need to retrieve that is the internet. Another benefit is unlimited storage as long as you want to continue to pay for more and more storage you can store as much data to the cloud as you want. Thirdly disaster recovery the cloud keeps frequent backups of work uploaded it to and sometimes the cloud is used by companies as a backup in case of a disaster.  

#### Resource Implications

The resource implications for a cloud server is simple as all it is from the user’s side is uploading and downloading work that you need or want to store. If you are somewhere with good internet, then uploading and downloading will not be a problem it comes when you don’t have internet access you can get your work. 

#### Communications

The communication is between the device that is uploading or downloading work from the server and the server its self. Work will be transferred via the internet between the two this is why the internet is so important for the cloud. Once the file is uploaded then the cloud will have a certain storage for the file under the users account.

#### Working Practice

This method can be used in many different work places and at home. For example, in a work place if you are running a different team under a project then everyone will need to access each other’s work. So to make it easy if everyone was to upload to the cloud under different folders then everyone can get a copy of the work and see each other’s progress in real time. Also at home if you want to retrieve data from your PC on your tablet then as long as it is saved on the cloud all you need to sign in and you will be able to open it. It can also be used in school to give out work to many students instead of emails. All the students could access the cloud though the internet on their own PCs.

#### Commercial Opportunity

The commercial opportunity for the cloud is very strong as almost all companies are on the internet and need storage so companies will hire out space to save data. Then once they fill up their storage they will hire out more. Also normal day to day people need storage as well so they will most likely hire out storage as well 

#### Information Sharing

The cloud is probably one of the best ways to share data as you can invite people to your work and they can work on it with you in real time and also they can save copies for themselves. Also if you are moving work from a personal cloud to someone else all you have to do Is email it or invite them to join it and then they can save it. 


## Cluster

#### Purpose

A cluster in networking is a bunch of PCs set to perform the same task controlled and scheduled by certain software. Clusters are usually connected to each other fast local area networks. With each node running its own instance of an operating system 

#### Benefits

The benefits of cluster networks are. Firstly, they are scalable which means that resources can be added to the cluster at any time. Secondly if a dedicated server from the cluster requires maintenance then it can be stopped while others servers handle its load. This means that it keeps running while under maintenance.

#### Communications

The way a cluster network communicates within its self is that the whole network is ran through a piece of software so the PCs don’t talk to each other they just all talk to the switch and router the PCs just work for the software.

#### Working Practice

Cluster networks are using in working practices to handle heavy loads of work as they can manage many computers at once and do many different tasks at once without putting too much stress on the network. for example, if you had 1 PC with 5 jobs to do that where automated but took an hour each then it is going to take 5 hours. If you were to run it on a cluster with 5 different PCs, then it would only take an hour

#### Commercial Opportunity

The commercial opportunity is high as a lot of web server companies and other server companies have a lot of data passing through them and can need sorting, fixing or work data will need to be pulled and assigning this to a cluster which can do the work of many different PCs will not only save time but money as well


## Centralised

#### Purpose

Centralised networks are when all the user’s PCs are connecting to a server with no internet connection it is just a bunch of PCs in a star lay out all connected to a single server. The server will store all their account information and handle all the communication that comes out of each PC. This can put a lot of stress on a single switch.

#### Benefits

Some benefits of using a centralised network are. Firstly, the network is easy to manage as it is all hooked up to a server. Secondly this can reduce the cost as most of the time these are ran in house so it can save money. Thirdly it is easy to add another user to the network as all you do is plug the PC in to the server and you are good to go. Finally, you can run everything though the server so you can roll out updates or work to all users

#### Resource Implications

The resource implications for a centralised network is firstly not expensive as you only have PCs and a server. Also, they are all hooked up though cables which can sometimes get in the way if not managed correctly but are consistent at passing data though. Thirdly the network can be running off the server and easily managed   

#### Communications

There is only one way the network communicates with each other and that is though cables that run to the server then the server puts it out to the other PCs. Nothing is connected to the internet so no data leaves the network though the PCs unless taken off the network and uploaded.

#### Working Practice

The way the network runs is entirely up to the person managing the network though the server and the people on the PCs. Centralised would normally be used by a team of people using the server to transfer work and data to one another if they were in a spread-out office as it is quicker than email or USB.

#### Information Sharing

Centralised is very good for sharing files in house. So, in an office for a team project but when it comes to getting work on the internet it cannot do so. As it is basically an inhouse version of a client server which runs the same but though the internet 


## Virtualised

#### Purpose 

Network virtualisation is the ability to create logical virtual networks that are run form the underlying network hardware to ensure the network can better integrate with virtual environments. So in simple terms you are creating a simulate of a hardware platform suck as a server, storage or any other network resource in a selected software.  

#### benefits

The first benefit of using virtualised networks are. That it saves spending time and money on actual hardware like buying it and then setting it up. The software will do that for you. Secondly the security is very strong on them as it will on be generated from one PC so if that PC is secure then the whole network should be secure. Another benefit if the energy costs as it would cost a lot to run multiple PCs and switches and many other network devices but you can do it for the energy cost of one PC if you virtualize it.

#### resource implications

the resource implications to run a virtualised network costs know where near the price of trying to run it with real hardware this is one of the main points why people do it. Also you can run it off one PC which will need to be high spec but you will still save money instead of buying all the hardware. Apart from a PC all you will need is an internet connection and if you are in an office block that is easy to get hold of.

## Design Of Network System

## Testing And Evaluation Of Design

We were tasked to create two local star network that connected via a switch to three PCs, One PC and a Router. Once we have created them we need to be able to ping from one of the PCs and be able to ping a PC on the other network. The design you can see above is how I will be going about these requirements and making the networks. Firstly, I needed to know the user requirements so I could break it down using Scrum.

*	Have Two Different Local Networks
*	Be Able To Add More PCs If Needed
*	Be Able Communicate Between the Two Networks
*	See That The Network Is Laid Out As A Star Network 
*	Be Able To Add Printers

These were the main 5 user requirements that we had to meet with are networking system. Firstly, we had to have two different local networks running independently with three PCs each and a server each. These 4 components then had to connect to a switch each then to a router. Once we had all of these on each side we could start to connect it all with straight though cable and get the two networks working.

Secondly we need to be able to add more PCs if it is needed later on down the road so when was setting up the switch which everything is connected to I added more slots for the cabling from the extra PCs. They may never be used but seeing as I had to add another to get the other three in you may as well fill it up just in case. This saves time if it come to adding more PCs.

Thirdly the two different local networks had to be able to communicate between each other so that a PC on one side can ping another on the other network. We got this to work by adding a Serial DTE cable running from the two serial ports on the routers together so that they are pretty much linked now packets can pass through to each other but they can be miles apart. We tested this by pinging one PC on the family guy side from the Simpson side. The result was that it worked 

The idea of the network was to make it a Star network, this means that there is centre and everything revolves around it. The centre of are networks where the switches. Everything had to run though the switches no matter where information was going.

As an extension we could add in two printers into the networks one on each side and get them to link up to the network as well.  

## Network System

The network above is the finished network completed to the spec of the user requirements and also it follows my design that you can see in the section above. I decided to add in the printers on each side as I had extra time when I finished the main part of the network. I have listed all of the information for the servers and routers. The network follows the design that I made earlier on in the project. It also meets all the requirements that I needed to meet. 

## Analyse Test Results 

I Created a test plan to show off the outcome of the final network against the design and requirements that it needed to meet from the start of the project. The test plan shows what was tested and the outcome. I also included the expected result which is what I wanted and expected to happen. Then the actual outcome which is what the real outcome was. I was hoping the actual outcome is the same as the expected outcome as that is what I need to happen to meet the requirements
